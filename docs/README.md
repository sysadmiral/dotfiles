# my dotfiles
This repository is a collection of my dotfiles and laptop configuration tools/scripts.

I've been influenced over the years by many others but have settled on the following things:

- I work on a chromebook
- On a chromebook the Linux environment is Debian
- I use [chezmoi][1] to manage dotfiles
- I use [ansible][2] for non-dotfiles things
- there are a few manual steps to use this repo - they're in [docs/](.docs/)
